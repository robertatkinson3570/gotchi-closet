FEATURE: “Take a Picture 📸” — Family Photo Snapshot (Cute + Funny)

SCOPE (DO NOT OVERTHINK THIS)
The Family Photo view already exists and works.
Add ONE delightful feature on top of it:

When the user is in Explorer → Mode = Mine / Owned → View = Family Photo:
- Show a “Take a picture” button
- Clicking it runs a playful photo moment:
  “Say Cheese!” → 3…2…1 → flash → PNG downloads

Do NOT redesign the page.
Do NOT change filters, cards, layout, or data.
This is pure fun + delight.

AVAILABILITY (HARD RULE)
- The “Take a picture” button ONLY appears when:
  - Explorer mode = Mine / Owned
  - View = Family Photo
- If user switches mode or view mid-countdown:
  - cancel everything gracefully
  - no download
  - no weird stuck overlays

BUTTON COPY (LOCKED)
- Button label: “Take a picture 📸”

COUNTDOWN UX (CUTE BUT NOT CRINGE)
On click:
- Show a centered overlay above the Family Photo grid
- Text:
  - Header: “Say Cheese! 🧀”
  - Subtext (small): “Everyone look spooky…”
- Countdown:
  - Big playful numbers:
    - 3
    - 2
    - 1
  - One per second
  - Slight bounce/scale animation on each number (subtle)

FLASH MOMENT
- After “1”:
  - Quick white flash overlay (120–180ms)
  - Feels like a camera flash, NOT a bug
  - Slight ease-in/ease-out
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
  - Skip animation, still capture

CAPTURE BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)
- Capture ONLY the Family Photo grid
- Do NOT include:
  - top nav
  - filter sidebar
  - mode/view toggles
  - “Say Cheese” overlay
  - flash overlay
- Capture should look exactly like the grid as the user sees it

If the grid scrolls:
- Prefer capturing the FULL grid content
- If not feasible without major complexity:
  - capture visible portion only
  - add a code comment explaining the limitation

DOWNLOAD
- Automatically download a PNG
- Filename format:
  - gotchi-family-photo_<shortWallet>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.png
  - If wallet unavailable: gotchi-family-photo_<YYYY-MM-DD>.png
- While saving:
  - disable button
  - button text becomes: “Saving the fam…”

TECH IMPLEMENTATION (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- Use client-side DOM-to-image capture
- Use existing dependency if present
- Otherwise add ONE lightweight lib:
  - html-to-image (preferred)
  - html2canvas (acceptable)
- No heavy frameworks

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Add a stable ref/id to the Family Photo grid container
   - Example: data-family-photo="true"
   - Do NOT change layout or styles
2) Add small state machine:
   - idle
   - countingDown
   - flashing
   - saving
3) Countdown logic:
   - 3 → 2 → 1 (1s each)
4) Flash:
   - show white overlay briefly
   - ensure it is NOT inside the captured element
5) Capture:
   - generate PNG
   - trigger browser download
6) Cleanup:
   - remove overlays
   - reset state
   - restore button

ERROR HANDLING (FRIENDLY)
- If capture fails:
  - show small toast:
    “Uh oh. The ghosts blinked. Try again 👻”
  - re-enable button

STYLING GUIDELINES
- Match GotchiCloset fonts, spacing, and colors
- Fun copy, but visuals stay:
  - clean
  - crisp
  - professional
- No confetti
- No loud colors
- No sound effects

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Button only appears in Mine + Family Photo
- Clicking feels delightful, not janky
- Countdown + flash read as intentional
- PNG downloads reliably
- Mobile works (tap → countdown → download)
- No regressions anywhere else

DELIVERABLE
Add the “Take a picture 📸” experience to the Family Photo view exactly as described, with playful copy and polished behavior.
