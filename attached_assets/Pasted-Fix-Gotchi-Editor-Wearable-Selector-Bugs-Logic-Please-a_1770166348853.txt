Fix Gotchi Editor + Wearable Selector Bugs & Logic

Please address the following issues and confirmations in the Gotchi Editor and Wearable Selector. Do not change unrelated UI or flows.

1. Wearable hover tooltip in Gotchi Editor

In the Gotchi Editor, when hovering over a wearable already equipped on a gotchi, show a tooltip with:

Wearable name

Trait modifiers (+/− traits)

This tooltip should behave and look the same as the tooltip used in the Wearable Selector.

2. “Filter Best Wearables” button should not toggle selector tabs

When clicking “Filter Best Wearables” in the Gotchi Editor:

The Wearable Selector must not auto-toggle tabs (All / Owned / Baazaar).

Tab state should remain exactly as the user last set it.

3. Owned wearables must always reflect actual ownership

Owned wearables should:

Always appear in the Owned tab of the Wearable Selector if the user owns them.

Not disappear simply because they are equipped on another gotchi.

Update dynamically as wearables are added to or removed from gotchis, but ownership must always be factored into the selector.

4. “Filter Best Wearables” must consistently filter across all tabs

When “Filter Best Wearables” is enabled:

All tabs (All / Owned / Baazaar) must show all wearables that are valid for the currently edited gotchi.

There are cases where valid wearables do not appear — this needs to be fixed.

Filtering logic must be consistent and deterministic.

5. Best Sets dropdown validation

In the Gotchi Selector, confirm that:

All listed sets actually apply to the gotchi currently in the editor.

A set is only shown if the gotchi’s traits match that set’s required +/− traits.

Example:

If a set requires SPK+ and BRN+, the gotchi must also be SPK+ and BRN+ for that set option to appear.

6. Slot filter state should persist when switching tabs

Current behavior:

Clicking a wearable slot correctly filters the selector to that slot.

Switching between All / Owned / Baazaar clears the slot filter, which feels wrong.

Required behavior:

Slot filter state must persist across tab changes.

Slot filter should only clear if the user explicitly clears or changes wearable filters.

7. Mommy Dress Me — never leave empty slots unnecessarily

Update the Mommy Dress Me logic with the following rules:

Global rules

Never leave a wearable slot empty if a suitable wearable exists.

A wearable must respect gotchi trait +/− alignment.

Strategy priority applies first, but BRS is always important.

If a wearable would clearly worsen the gotchi, it may be left empty.

Highest BRS

Always attempt to complete a matching set first.

After set completion, fill all remaining slots with the best available wearables.

Never leave empty slots if a wearable improves or maintains BRS.

Trait Sculptor

Primary goal: maximize the number of strongest like traits.

Examples (best to worst):

104,104,104,104

104,104,104

104,104,98,75

Try for:

Four matching strong traits

Then three

Then two

Then one

After achieving the strongest trait configuration possible, fill remaining slots with valid wearables.

Balanced mode currently does nothing — confirm or fix.

Dual Trait

Prioritize two strong traits.

If not possible, fall back to one strong trait.

After that, fill remaining slots where valid.

Dominant

Focus entirely on one trait (current behavior mostly correct).

After locking the dominant trait, still fill remaining slots if valid wearables exist.

Respec

Current respec handling looks correct, but verify it still respects all the above logic.

Do not change unrelated editor behavior.
Do not change UI layouts.
Focus only on fixing state, filtering, and logic correctness.
