TASK: Add a “Catwalk” button on the Dress page that opens a full-screen modal overlay and animates all Gotchis currently in the Gotchi Selector in rarity order using alternating “model-style” catwalk moves. This is purely visual (no trait/BRS/respec/respect changes). Must not affect existing Dress page logic, state, or layout.

APP CONTEXT
- App: GotchiCloset (React + Vite)
- Page: Dress page (Gotchi Selector + Gotchi Editor)
- Gotchis are already renderable as SVGs or preview images.
- Catwalk must feel native to Aavegotchi: playful, cartoonish, ghosty (NOT realistic fashion runway).

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS
1) DO NOT change any existing calculations or data: traits, BRS, wearables, sets, respec, respect, rarity, selector state.
2) DO NOT restructure the Dress page. Catwalk must be a modal overlay (position: fixed) so no layout shifts occur.
3) Visual-only feature. No state mutation, no saving, no side effects.
4) Use transforms only (translate, scale, rotate, opacity). No top/left animation.
5) No true 3D or real 360 assets. Gotchis are flat SVGs.
6) Modal must have Close (X), Replay, ESC-to-close, and backdrop click to close.
7) Lock body scroll while modal is open; restore on close.
8) Respect prefers-reduced-motion. If enabled, skip animations and show a static gallery with a note.
9) Must be performant even with many gotchis (limit heavy re-renders).

FEATURE OVERVIEW
- Add a button labeled “Catwalk” on the Dress page header near existing controls.
- Clicking opens <CatwalkModal />.
- Modal behavior:
  - Sort all gotchis currently in the Gotchi Selector by rarityScore DESC (highest first).
  - All gotchis appear “backstage” in the background.
  - One gotchi at a time walks the Catwalk in the foreground.
  - Each gotchi performs one “model-style” move at center stage.
  - Sequence continues until all gotchis have walked.
  - End screen appears with Replay + Back to Dress.

DATA INPUTS
- Pass CatwalkModal the current selector gotchi list with:
  - tokenId (number or string)
  - rarityScore (number; default 0 if missing)
  - renderable SVG or preview source already used in the app
- IMPORTANT:
  - Use a lightweight GotchiPreview renderer.
  - Do NOT mount the full Gotchi Editor component inside the modal.
  - Reuse existing preview components if available, but in compact mode only.

UI COPY (LOCKED)
- Button: “Catwalk”
- Modal badge: “CATWALK MODE”
- Subtext: “Pure vibes. Zero stat changes.”
- Backstage label: “Backstage”
- End headline: “That’s the show”
- End subtext: “All gotchis have walked the Catwalk.”
- Buttons: “Replay”, “Back to Dress”
- Reduced motion note: “Reduced motion enabled. Animations disabled.”

VISUAL STYLE
- Cartoon haunted stage aesthetic (Aavegotchi-native).
- Background: dark purple/teal gradient with subtle floating particles (CSS-only).
- Runway: floating platform or stitched planks with soft cartoon glow.
- Spotlight: blob-shaped light that softly follows the active gotchi.
- Backstage gotchis:
  - Smaller scale
  - Opacity ~0.4
  - Slight idle float
- Active gotchi:
  - Larger scale (1.6–2x)
  - Centered on runway
  - No overlapping with others

ANIMATION SEQUENCE (PER GOTCHI)
Total duration per gotchi: ~2.2–2.8s depending on move.

Phases:
1) ENTER
   - Start off-screen (left by default, occasionally right).
   - Glide to center with ghosty float:
     - translateX + subtle bob (2–4px)
     - slight sway (±1–2deg)
   - Duration: 1100–1400ms

2) CENTER PAUSE
   - Duration: 150–300ms
   - Name + rarity label fades in

3) MODEL MOVE (ONE PER GOTCHI)
   - Deterministically selected from the Move Pack (see below)

4) EXIT
   - Glide off-screen opposite side
   - Duration: 700–900ms

MOVE PACK (MODEL-STYLE POSES)
Each gotchi uses ONE move, selected deterministically via tokenId seed.
Use these exact move identifiers:

1) CLASSIC_TWIRL
   - rotateZ: 0 → 360deg
   - duration: ~650ms
   - slight scale overshoot (1 → 1.04 → 1)

2) HALF_TURN_ILLUSION
   - rotateZ: 0 → 18 → -12 → 0
   - optional rotateY: 0 → 60 → 0 with scaleX dip at peak
   - NO rotation beyond 70deg on Y axis

3) PIVOT_POSE
   - micro slide: x +10px → 0
   - rotateZ: 0 → 120 → 0
   - bob during pivot

4) SQUASH_STRETCH_POSE
   - scaleY: 1 → 0.92 → 1.03 → 1
   - scaleX: 1 → 1.05 → 0.98 → 1
   - rotateZ: 0 → 6 → -4 → 0

5) FLOAT_STRUT
   - y: 0 → -6 → 0
   - rotateZ: -4 → +4 → -2 → 0
   - no spin

6) SPOTLIGHT_POP
   - scale: 1 → 1.08 → 1
   - spotlight brightness increases briefly (~200ms)

7) MOONWALK_EXIT (RARE)
   - exit movement appears backward briefly before normal exit
   - Use for <=10% of gotchis only

MOVE SELECTION LOGIC
- Define MOVES array in fixed order.
- moveIndex = tokenId % MOVES.length
- entrySide:
  - if (tokenId % 100 < 10) enter from right
  - else enter from left
- All variation must be deterministic (same gotchi always performs same move).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Modal internal state:
  - status: "idle" | "running" | "done"
  - activeIndex
  - phase: "enter" | "pause" | "move" | "exit"
  - reducedMotion (from matchMedia)
- Use animationend events and short setTimeouts for phase transitions.
- Do NOT introduce new animation libraries unless already present.
- Prefer CSS keyframes + React state.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Focus trap inside modal.
- ESC closes modal.
- ARIA labels on buttons.
- Reduced motion fallback required.

FILES / STRUCTURE
- New folder: src/components/catwalk/
  - CatwalkModal.tsx
  - GotchiPreview.tsx (if needed)
  - catwalk.module.css (or Tailwind classes if used)
- Dress page:
  - Add Catwalk button
  - Pass current selector gotchis into modal
  - No changes to existing selector/editor logic

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Clicking Catwalk opens modal instantly with no layout shift.
- Gotchis walk in rarity DESC order.
- Each gotchi performs exactly one deterministic model move.
- Closing returns user to identical Dress page state.
- No trait, rarity, wearable, or selector changes.
- Mobile and desktop supported.
- Zero-gotchis selected: disable button or show “No gotchis in selector”.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement Catwalk button + modal per spec.
- Keep changes tightly scoped.
- Add short comments explaining rarity sort and move selection.
