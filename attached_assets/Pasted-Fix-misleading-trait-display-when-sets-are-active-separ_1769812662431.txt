Fix misleading trait display when sets are active (separate wearables vs sets)

Goal
In the Dress page “Traits” panel, when sets are active (ex: Quickswap Dragon), equipping a wearable (ex: Pet → Uncommon Rofl) appears to change traits in the wrong direction because the UI shows only base and final, while wearable rows show wearable-only modifiers.

We need to make the Traits display unambiguous by separating:

base traits

wearables contribution

set bonus contribution

final traits

Concrete example (must look correct in UI)
Gotchi: z - Typhon (ID: 14625)
Base traits: [-3, 96, 97, -3] shown as left numbers

With current loadout:

wearableDelta total = [-2, 6, 5, -2]

setDelta (Dragon set) = [3, 0, 1, 1]

final = [-2, 102, 103, -4]

When equipping Pet → Uncommon Rofl (modifiers [-1, 0, 0, -1]), the wearableDelta changes appropriately, but the final NRG can still increase because setDelta includes +3 NRG.

Required UI behavior
Keep the existing trait row layout, but add one of these minimal clarity options:

Option A (preferred): show breakdown on each trait row

For each trait (NRG/AGG/SPK/BRN), display:

the existing base (final) format

plus a small sublabel or tooltip:
Wearables: X, Sets: Y
Example for NRG on Typhon after equipping pet:
NRG -3 (-2)
Wearables: -2 Sets: +3

Option B: add a compact “Set bonuses” mini-block above/below Traits

If any active sets exist:

show a small line: Set bonuses: NRG +3, SPK +1, BRN +1 (only non-zero)

keep trait numbers as-is

Implementation details

We already compute:

baseTraits

wearableDelta

setDelta

finalTraits
Use these exact values in the UI (do not recompute a second way).

Update the Traits component to accept (or derive) wearableDelta and setDelta and render them.

Only render breakdown UI when there is any non-zero setDelta OR when sets are active.

Do not change any calculation logic; only change display/labeling.

No layout overhaul — keep current trait rows and spacing. Add subtext in smaller font, muted color.

Acceptance criteria

With Typhon (14625) and Quickswap Dragon active, equipping Uncommon Rofl no longer looks like it applied +2 NRG.

Trait panel clearly communicates that +3 NRG is coming from the Dragon set.

Wearable row still shows N-1, B-1 for Uncommon Rofl.

No changes to Dress page behavior besides clearer display.
