FEATURE: Gotchi Explorer (Super Page – Mobile-First)

GOAL
Add a new Explorer page to GotchiCloset that allows users to browse, filter, and inspect Aavegotchis at very high information density, while still being fully usable and fast on mobile. This page must feel like a “power-user terminal” on desktop AND a compact, swipeable inspector on mobile.

Mobile friendliness is a HARD REQUIREMENT, not optional.

ROUTING / NAV
- Add new route: /explorer
- Add top-nav link: “Explorer”
- Page title: Gotchi Explorer
- Subtitle (desktop only): “Browse, filter, and inspect Gotchis without leaving the page.”

DATA MODES (TOP TOGGLE – STICKY)
Segmented toggle (single active at a time):
- Mine
- All
- Baazaar
- Auction

Behavior:
- Mine: loads gotchis owned by connected wallet OR manually entered address
- All: loads entire collection
- Baazaar: only listed gotchis
- Auction: only auctioned gotchis

Manual address input:
- Visible when Mine is active
- Accepts any valid EVM address
- Shows “Viewing: 0xabc…123” with clear (X) to reset

Mobile:
- Toggle row is horizontally scrollable if needed
- Toggle row stays sticky at top

DESKTOP:
- Toggle + search + sort in a single top bar

MOBILE:
- Toggle row
- Search icon opens full-width search input

LAZY LOADING / PERFORMANCE
- No visible pagination
- Initial load: ~80 gotchis on mobile, ~120 on desktop
- Load next batch automatically on scroll
- Virtualize grid (render only visible cards)
- Cache gotchi preview data by tokenId
- Use IntersectionObserver for images/SVGs
- Filters always operate on already-loaded data + continue applying as new data loads
