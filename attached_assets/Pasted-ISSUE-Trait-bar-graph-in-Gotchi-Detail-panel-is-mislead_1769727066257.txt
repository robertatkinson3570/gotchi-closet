ISSUE: Trait bar graph in Gotchi Detail panel is misleading, noisy, and not useful for Explorer context

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The current trait display uses horizontal bar graphs with +/- deltas (see screenshot). This visualization is NOT working for the Gotchi Explorer and actively makes the UI worse.

WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM (DO NOT IGNORE)

1) Bars imply a “progress toward a goal” that does not exist
- NRG / AGG / SPK / BRN are NOT progress metrics.
- They are static numeric traits, not values that should feel like “more filled = better”.
- A bar graph falsely suggests optimization or completion.

2) The +/- delta numbers are confusing and contextless
- “-13”, “-17”, etc. have no obvious reference point.
- Is this vs base traits? vs average? vs wearables? vs something else?
- In Explorer / detail context, this forces the user to mentally decode math they did not ask for.

3) Bars waste vertical space in a dense, information-heavy panel
- Explorer detail panels must be compact and scannable.
- Four large bars consume too much space for too little signal.
- This reduces how much other important info (eyes, rarity, kinship, market data) can be shown without scrolling.

4) Bars are visually loud but informationally weak
- Color-heavy bars draw attention away from more important signals (rarity, eye rarity, GHST, kinship).
- Users care more about relative strength (highest / lowest trait) than exact fill length.

5) This pattern does not scale well to mobile
- On mobile, bars become cramped, ambiguous, and require extra vertical scrolling.
- Numeric traits should remain readable at a glance.

WHAT TO DO INSTEAD (REQUIRED CHANGE)

Replace the bar graph with a **compact, numeric-first trait display** that is:
- Dense
- Scannable
- Honest about what the data represents

RECOMMENDED TRAIT DISPLAY (EXPLORER DETAIL PANEL)

For each trait:
- Show numeric value prominently (e.g. 87)
- Optional small delta (only if clearly labeled, otherwise remove)
- Minimal visual indicator:
  - small dot / tick / micro-bar OR
  - highlight strongest trait
  - highlight weakest trait

Example layout (conceptual):
NRG  87
AGG  65
SPK  92  ★ (highest)
BRN  54  ↓ (lowest)

Rules:
- No large horizontal bars
- No progress metaphors
- No unlabeled deltas
- Visual emphasis only where it adds meaning

OPTIONAL (NICE BUT NOT REQUIRED)
- Add subtle color coding for high / low extremes
- Add tooltip explaining what traits represent (Explorer only)
- Allow compact mode vs expanded mode (desktop only)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Remove the current bar graph UI from the Gotchi Explorer detail panel.
- Do NOT reuse this pattern elsewhere in Explorer.
- Do NOT introduce new charting libraries.
- Keep the replacement layout tight, professional, and consistent with GotchiCloset styling.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Traits are readable at a glance.
- Users understand values without explanation.
- Detail panel feels less cluttered.
- Mobile view improves immediately.
