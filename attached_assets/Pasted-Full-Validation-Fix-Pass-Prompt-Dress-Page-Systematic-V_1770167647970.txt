Full Validation & Fix Pass

Prompt: Dress Page Systematic Validation & Repair

You are performing a full feature validation pass on the Dress page only.

This page is production-critical.
Prefer correctness and state safety over cleverness.

Hard rules (do not violate)

Do not change UI layout, spacing, or visual design

Do not refactor unrelated logic

Do not rename components, hooks, or state unless required to fix a bug

Do not touch other pages

Preserve all behavior that currently works

What to test (follow in this order)
1. Initial load & default state

Verify on first load:

Gotchi selector initializes correctly

First gotchi loads dressed correctly

Wearable Selector defaults (tabs, filters, slot state) are correct

No filters are implicitly applied

No state mutates before user interaction

Fix any unexpected side effects.

2. Gotchi selection

Test:

Switching between gotchis

Returning to a previously selected gotchi

Confirm:

Equipped wearables match the gotchi

Trait values and BRS update correctly

Wearable Selector reflects the current gotchi

No filters, tabs, or slot states reset unless explicitly intended

3. Wearable Selector tabs

Test All / Owned / Baazaar:

Switching tabs does not reset filters

Switching tabs does not reset slot filtering

Owned tab always reflects true ownership

Baazaar tab only shows listed items

All tab includes everything valid

Fix any tab causing unintended state resets.

4. Slot filtering behavior

Test:

Clicking a wearable slot filters the selector to that slot

Switching tabs while a slot filter is active

Clearing slot filters manually

Expected behavior:

Slot filter persists across tab changes

Slot filter only clears when explicitly cleared or changed

No silent unfiltering

5. “Filter Best Wearables” button

Test:

Enable / disable repeatedly

Enable → switch tabs

Enable → click slot → switch tabs

Enable → change gotchi

Confirm:

It never toggles selector tabs

It applies consistently across all tabs

All valid wearables appear (no missing items)

Disabling restores previous state cleanly

Fix any inconsistent filtering logic.

6. Equipping / unequipping wearables

Test:

Equip wearable manually

Remove wearable

Equip on multiple gotchis

Swap wearables rapidly

Confirm:

Trait deltas update correctly

BRS updates correctly

Ownership logic is preserved

Wearable Selector updates without losing state

7. Mommy Dress Me feature

Test each mode:

Highest BRS

Trait Sculptor

Dual Trait

Dominant

Confirm:

Strategy logic is respected

Empty slots are only left empty if equipping would worsen results

Sets are completed when possible

Remaining slots are filled when valid wearables exist

Respec logic applies correctly and does not over-apply

Fix any mode that violates these rules.

8. Cross-feature safety

Test interactions between:

Manual equip ↔ Mommy Dress Me

Filters ↔ Manual changes

Slot filtering ↔ Auto dressing

Confirm:

No feature silently overrides another

User intent always wins

State remains predictable

Fix rules

When an issue is found:

Identify the root cause briefly

Apply the smallest possible fix

Prefer explicit state over derived magic

No speculative optimizations
