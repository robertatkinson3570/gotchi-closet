Fix Uncommon Rofl Pet trait modifiers (Dress page)

Goal
On the Dress page, equipping Pet → “Uncommon Rofl” applies the wrong trait deltas. The UI currently shows N-1, B-1 for the pet, but the resulting trait totals change as if it applied NRG +2 and AGG -1. This is incorrect.

Correct behavior
Equipping Uncommon Rofl must apply exactly:

NRG -1

BRN -1
…and must NOT change AGG or SPK.

Observed bug example (must match after fix)
Gotchi: z - Typhon (ID: 14625)
Before pet: NRG -3 (-4), AGG 96 (103), SPK 97 (103), BRN -3 (-4)
After equipping Uncommon Rofl (correct): NRG should become -3 (-5) (or net -1 from prior), BRN should net -1 from prior, and AGG/SPK should stay the same.
Currently it shifts like NRG (-4 → -2) and AGG changes, which indicates wrong modifiers are being applied.

What to change (minimal + targeted)
1) Verify we are resolving the correct wearable item/ID for “Uncommon Rofl”

Somewhere we map a selected wearable (slot + name/rarity) to a wearable record (likely from:

local wearables JSON,

subgraph data,

or a combined “wearables catalog” list)

Fix requirement: ensure “Uncommon Rofl” resolves to the wearable record whose modifiers are [-1, 0, 0, -1] (NRG, AGG, SPK, BRN).

If the record for Uncommon Rofl is wrong/mismatched (e.g., mapping to a different “Rofl” variant), fix the mapping so the selected option references the correct wearable ID.

2) Verify trait modifier index order is consistent everywhere

We’ve had trait-index mapping issues before. Ensure the modifier array is interpreted as:

[NRG, AGG, SPK, BRN]

If any code path applies modifiers in a different order (or uses a wrong trait key mapping for pets only), fix that to be consistent.

3) Add a narrow regression guard for this specific case

Add a tiny test or runtime assertion in dev to prevent future regressions:

When wearable name includes "Rofl" and rarity includes "Uncommon" (or wearableId matches the resolved ID), assert computed modifiers are exactly:

nrg: -1

agg: 0

spk: 0

brn: -1

This should be a small unit test if we have tests, otherwise a dev-only console warn.

Acceptance Criteria

Equipping Pet → Uncommon Rofl applies NRG -1 and BRN -1 and nothing else.

The per-item modifier pills/labels (N-1, B-1) match the computed totals.

No other wearables are affected.

No UI changes besides corrected numbers.

Implementation Notes (don’t refactor)

Keep all existing Dress page UI + state structure.

Only adjust the wearable lookup + modifier application logic needed to fix this one mismatch.

If data source is wrong, patch the specific wearable record for Uncommon Rofl (ID + modifiers) rather than reshaping the entire wearables dataset.

Deliverables

Patch the lookup so “Uncommon Rofl” resolves to the correct wearable record.

Ensure applied modifiers for that item are [-1, 0, 0, -1].

Add a minimal regression test or dev assertion.
