STOP: This is NOT a data/on-chain issue and NOT a cache-busting issue.

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR
On Explorer, I can briefly see the correct naked outline/spirit-force color (e.g., UNI Gotchi #1455 “Lily” shows pink for a moment), then it changes to the wrong color. That means:
- The initial render is correct
- Something AFTER render is overriding/replacing/mutating the SVG or its styling

Therefore: DO NOT spend time on on-chain reads, subgraph fields, or cache-busting URLs.
Focus ONLY on post-render behavior.

GOAL
Make Explorer naked Gotchi rendering match Dress page and remain stable (no color flip after initial render).

LIKELY ROOT CAUSES (INVESTIGATE THESE FIRST)
1) Explorer is swapping the SVG source after mount
   - e.g. initial inline SVG -> later replaced with a “fallback” sprite, cached variant, or different renderer
   - or React state updates cause a different SVG string to be set

2) CSS is being applied after mount (hydration/theme) that alters SVG visuals
   - CSS filter: hue-rotate, saturate, brightness
   - mix-blend-mode, opacity overlays
   - a container “tint” layer above the SVG
   - global SVG styles (e.g. svg path { fill: ... } ) leaking in

3) A “naked preview” hover state is fighting with a “card render” state
   - the image hover (naked) and the info hover are competing
   - or a timed effect / lazy-load swaps the element

4) Virtualization / recycling DOM nodes in the grid
   - list virtualization reuses DOM elements and updates props
   - stale styles/classes persist between cards
   - keying is wrong (e.g. using array index keys)

5) Image rendering path differs between first paint and after effect
   - initial SSR/hydration mismatch
   - useEffect sets “src”/markup after hydration

REQUIRED DIAGNOSIS (DO THIS, NO GUESSING)
For Gotchi #1455 in Explorer:
A) Verify whether the DOM node for the SVG is being replaced.
   - Add a MutationObserver on the gotchi SVG container for that card.
   - Log when child nodes are replaced / attributes change.
B) Log className changes on:
   - the SVG element
   - its container wrappers
C) In DevTools, check computed styles for the SVG/container BEFORE and AFTER the color flip:
   - filter
   - opacity
   - mix-blend-mode
   - background overlays
   - any CSS variables affecting color

Also inspect if the rendered node changes from:
- inline <svg> markup
to
- <img src=...> or <canvas> or different SVG string

FIX REQUIREMENTS
1) Prevent post-render swapping to an alternate renderer for naked gotchis.
   - Ensure the same SVG string/render path persists through state updates.
   - If there is a “placeholder” then a later “resolved” SVG, make sure both are the same source.

2) Remove/disable any CSS that alters the SVG colors in Explorer.
   - No hue-rotate, saturate, brightness, or blend filters on the gotchi image container.
   - No overlay layers that tint the gotchi.
   - Ensure SVG paths are not being targeted by global CSS.

3) Fix virtualization keying if applicable.
   - Do NOT use array index as key.
   - Use stable key: tokenId (and also include “naked/dressed mode” if both exist).
   - Ensure recycled rows don’t keep stale classes/styles.

4) Ensure the naked-preview hover is isolated.
   - The gotchi IMAGE hover logic should only swap dress->naked visuals, not apply any tint/filter.
   - Hovering “info area” must not affect image rendering.

SPECIFIC ANTI-PATTERNS TO REMOVE
- Do NOT add cache-busting query params.
- Do NOT re-fetch SVGs repeatedly.
- Do NOT hardcode UNI=pink as a patch.
- Do NOT add random timeouts to “wait for render.”

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- In Explorer, Gotchi #1455 (UNI) naked outline stays pink and never flips.
- Explorer matches Dress page for naked rendering across multiple collateral types.
- No CSS filter or overlay changes colors after mount.
- No DOM replacement occurs after initial correct render (or if it does, the replacement is identical).

DELIVERABLE
A concrete fix to Explorer rendering/styling that stops the post-render color change. Remove debug observers/logging after confirming.
