Mommy Dress Me Logic Fixes & Clarifications

Update the Mommy Dress Me feature with the following rules and behavior. Do not change unrelated UI or flows.

Global Rule (Critical)

When Mommy Dress Me runs, it must always assume the Gotchi starts naked.
Ignore all currently equipped wearables when calculating optimizations.
Current wearables should never cause the system to early-exit or claim “already optimized.”

Trait Direction Rules (Must Enforce Everywhere)

Traits below 50 improve by moving down

Traits above 50 improve by moving up

Never equip a wearable that moves a trait in the wrong direction

Never equip a wearable that lowers total BRS

Example:

BRN = 48 → −BRN is good, +BRN is bad

Trait Sculptor must never accept a wearable that reduces BRS

Set & Wearable Evaluation

Wearable set bonuses must always be considered

However, best sets do not always equal best trait outcomes

Reuse existing logic from:

Best Sets selector

Best Wearables selector

Evaluate:

Set bonuses

Individual wearable modifiers

Combined BRS impact

Trait Sculptor Logic
General

Trait Sculptor must evaluate traits based on mathematical potential, not current state.

If traits are:

1, 3, 35, 45 → ignore 35 and 45 entirely
Focus only on 1 and 3 and optimize those

1, 3, 2, 45 → attempt to make 1, 3, and 2 equal only if possible

If equalizable → optimize all (e.g. −4, −4, −4, 45)

If not → fall back to fewer traits (e.g. −8, −8, 2, 45)

User-Selected Modes

Balanced

Try optimizing 4 traits

If not possible → try 3

If not possible → try 2

If not possible → optimize 1 best trait

Dual

Try optimizing 2 traits equally

If not possible → fall back to 1

1 Dominant Trait

Identify which trait can be maximized the most

Use respec + sets + wearables to push that trait as far as possible

Example result: 1, 3, −14, 45

Fill remaining slots only with wearables that do not reduce BRS and preferably support the chosen set

Max BRS Mode

Always start from a naked Gotchi

Respec does not matter

Set bonus takes priority

Never equip a wearable that lowers BRS

Must re-optimize even if the Gotchi is already dressed

Never assume “already optimized” based on current wearables

Known Issues This Must Fix

Max BRS incorrectly exits when Gotchi is already dressed

Trait Sculptor (1 dominant trait) does not currently search for the best possible trait

Dual/Balanced builds are incorrectly treated as optimal for other modes

Each Mommy Dress Me run must fully recompute based on the selected mode, starting from a naked Gotchi, regardless of the Gotchi’s current equipment.
