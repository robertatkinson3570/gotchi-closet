FEATURE: “Family Photo” View (Owned-Only) — Gotchi Explorer

GOAL
Add a new Explorer view mode called “Family Photo” that provides a dense, roster-style overview of a user’s OWNED Gotchis only. This view is designed for fast scanning, comparison, and sharing (a “contact sheet” or “yearbook” for your wallet).

This view must feel sleek, professional, and intentional — not gimmicky. Styling should match GotchiCloset’s existing aesthetic: crisp typography, tight spacing, muted colors, and subtle accents.

This is a VIEW MODE only. It reuses existing Explorer data, filters, and sorts.

AVAILABILITY RULE (IMPORTANT)
- The “Family Photo” view option must ONLY be available when:
  - Explorer mode = “Mine / Owned”
- If mode is:
  - All
  - Baazaar
  - Auction
  → Family Photo option must be hidden (not disabled).
- If user switches away from Mine while Family Photo is active:
  - Automatically revert to default “Cards” view.

VIEW MODE TOGGLE
- View selector located near Sort controls.
- Options:
  - Cards
  - Dense (if present)
  - Family Photo (Owned-only)
- Remember last selected view per mode in localStorage.

FAMILY PHOTO — DEFAULT PRESENTATION
- Default: **tiny gotchi thumbnails + name + rarity**
- Default sort when entering Family Photo:
  - Rarity score DESC
- Designed to show as many Gotchis as possible without looking cluttered.

FAMILY PHOTO — LAYOUT & DENSITY
DESKTOP:
- 8–12 items per row depending on viewport
- Tight, uniform grid (contact-sheet style)
- No card borders, no heavy shadows
- Subtle hover highlight only (background tint or underline)

MOBILE:
- 3–5 items per row
- Touch-friendly spacing
- Sticky top bar for View + Sort
- No hover-only interactions

Each Family Photo tile includes:
- Tiny gotchi image (transparent SVG, no border or card frame)
- Gotchi name (single line, ellipsis)
- Rarity score (small, numeric, secondary color)

Optional micro-icons (icons only, no text):
- Listed on Baazaar
- In Auction
- Full set equipped

No additional stats are shown by default in this view.

TEXT-ONLY TOGGLE (WITHIN FAMILY PHOTO)
- Inside Family Photo view only, add a minimal toggle:
  - “Thumbnails” (default ON)
  - “Text-only”
- Styling:
  - Small icon toggle (no large labels)
  - Subtle, professional (not playful)

Text-only mode behavior:
- Hide gotchi images entirely
- Show:
  - Name
  - Token ID (small)
  - Rarity score
- Increase density further (more items per row)
- Grid layout (NOT a table)

INTERACTIONS
DESKTOP:
- Click tile → open Gotchi Detail Drawer
- Right-click → quick actions menu

MOBILE:
- Tap tile → open Gotchi Detail Drawer
- Long-press → quick actions menu

Quick actions:
- Add to Dress selector
- Open in Dress

FILTERS & SORTS
- Family Photo must respect ALL active Explorer filters and sorts.
- Filters remain accessible via the collapsible filter sidebar.
- Sorting updates Family Photo instantly.
- No navigation or reloads.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- Must be extremely fast for large wallets.
- Use existing virtualization/windowing strategy.
- Reuse cached gotchi preview data.
- Do NOT refetch SVGs.
- Text-only mode must avoid rendering images entirely.

STYLING & AESTHETICS (IMPORTANT)
- Match GotchiCloset’s existing:
  - font family
  - color palette
  - spacing rhythm
- Visual goals:
  - clean
  - modern
  - confident
  - understated
- Avoid:
  - playful gimmicks
  - loud colors
  - heavy borders
  - excessive animations
- Animations (if any):
  - subtle fade/translate on mount
  - respect prefers-reduced-motion

ACCESSIBILITY
- Keyboard navigable on desktop
- Adequate tap targets on mobile
- Truncated names reveal full value on tooltip (desktop) or long-press (mobile)

FILES / STRUCTURE
- Update ExplorerGrid to support Family Photo view OR add:
  - FamilyPhotoGrid.tsx
  - FamilyPhotoItem.tsx
- Reuse:
  - existing Explorer data hooks
  - existing filters/sorts
  - existing Gotchi Detail Drawer

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Family Photo is OWNED-ONLY.
- Must not appear in All / Baazaar / Auction modes.
- Must not affect Card or Dense views.
- No new data fetching.
- No battler or combat-related info.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Users can view their entire wallet at a glance.
- Family Photo looks intentional, premium, and polished.
- Switching modes never leaves the UI in a broken state.
- Mobile experience is as good as desktop.
