FEATURE: Add “Wearables Explorer” to the existing Explorer page (multi-asset Explorer)

GOAL
Extend the existing Gotchi Explorer into a multi-asset Explorer by adding support for browsing Wearables. The Gotchi Explorer must remain unchanged in behavior and layout. Wearables are a new asset type, accessed via a tab or toggle, and displayed using the same Explorer-style UX (filters, sorts, dense grid, no navigation away).

This is NOT the Dress page.
This is NOT a modal.
This is a parallel Explorer view for Wearables.

HIGH-LEVEL UX
- Explorer page gains an asset selector:
  - Gotchis
  - Wearables
- Switching assets swaps the Explorer content while keeping:
  - top search
  - mode toggles (All / Owned / Baazaar)
  - filter sidebar
  - grid layout philosophy

Asset selection must be instant and not reload the page.

ASSET MODES (REUSED)
Wearables Explorer supports the same modes:
- All
- Owned
- Baazaar

Behavior:
- All: all wearables in collection
- Owned: wearables owned by connected wallet or entered address
- Baazaar: wearables currently listed for sale

Auction mode is NOT required for wearables at this stage.

SEARCH
- Search by wearable name
- Search by wearable ID
- Case-insensitive
- Live filtering

WEARABLE DATA SOURCE
- Reuse the wearable data and rendering logic already used in the Dress page.
- Do NOT duplicate wearable SVG rendering logic.
- Do NOT change Dress page behavior.
- Lift shared logic into reusable components if needed.

WEARABLE GRID (EXPLORER STYLE)
- Dense, scrollable grid similar to Gotchi Explorer (not the Dress selector layout).
- Cards are compact, uniform, and scannable.
- Show many wearables per screen.

Each wearable card should show:
- Wearable image (same asset as Dress page)
- Wearable name
- Wearable slot (Head, Face, Body, Hands, etc.)
- Trait modifiers (NRG / AGG / SPK / BRN deltas, numeric only)
- Quantity owned (Owned mode)
- Price (Baazaar mode only)

NO large descriptions.
NO sliders.
NO progress bars.

Owned mode:
- Quantity owned ↑ ↓

Baazaar mode:
- Price ↑ ↓
- Cheapest first
- Rarity per GHST (optional)

LAYOUT RULES
- Keep the same Explorer layout:
  - search + asset toggle at top
  - mode toggle (All / Owned / Baazaar)
  - left filter sidebar
  - main grid
- Do NOT copy Dress page layout positioning.
- Explorer layout > Dress layout.

INTERACTIONS
- Hover (desktop):
  - Show slightly expanded wearable info (trait deltas)
- Click:
  - Optional mini info overlay or drawer (lightweight)
- No heavy detail panels required for v1.

MOBILE REQUIREMENTS
- Asset toggle becomes segmented control
- Filters open as bottom sheet
- Grid adapts to 2–4 items per row
- Touch-friendly cards
- No hover-only required info

FILES / STRUCTURE
- Extend existing Explorer page to support assetType:
  - "gotchi"
  - "wearable"
- Suggested components:
  - ExplorerAssetToggle.tsx
  - WearableExplorerGrid.tsx
  - WearableExplorerCard.tsx
  - useWearableExplorerData.ts
- Reuse:
  - Dress wearable renderer
  - Existing Explorer filter/sort infrastructure

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Gotchi Explorer behavior must remain unchanged.
- No changes to Dress page logic.
- No duplication of wearable rendering code.
- Wearables must feel like a first-class Explorer asset, not a copy-paste.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- User can switch between Gotchis and Wearables instantly.
- Wearables can be browsed, filtered, and sorted like Gotchis.
- Owned vs Baazaar modes work cleanly.
- UI feels cohesive and intentional.
- Mobile experience is solid.

DELIVERABLE
Add Wearables as a new asset type in the Explorer page, using Explorer-grade filters, sorting, and layout, while reusing Dress page wearable rendering.
