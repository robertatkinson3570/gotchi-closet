POLISH PASS: Catwalk modal works but looks bad. Fix visuals + staging + motion quality. Do NOT change any dress/editor logic or state. Keep Catwalk as modal overlay only.

PROBLEMS TO FIX (OBSERVED)
- Backstage gotchis are bottom-left thumbnails. Needs to look like a lineup behind the runway.
- No runway/stage; just a line. Needs a cartoon runway platform + depth.
- Active gotchi floats in empty space; needs grounding (shadow + alignment to runway).
- Some gotchis render as white tiles/boxes; either render SVG with transparent background or wrap as intentional “card frame”.
- Motion feels like teleport / slide; needs easing + bob + pose timing.
- Occasional blank/grey placeholder: images not preloaded before sequence starts.

GOALS
- Make the Catwalk scene feel Aavegotchi-cartoon: haunted/carnival stage, playful and clean.
- Composition must read instantly: BACKSTAGE (center) → RUNWAY (foreground) → ACTIVE WALKER (on runway).
- Ensure every gotchi is loaded before animation begins (no placeholders mid-show).

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1) PRELOAD ASSETS BEFORE START
   - When modal opens, preload all gotchi preview images/SVGs used in Catwalk.
   - Show a “Loading Catwalk…” state until ALL assets are ready.
   - Only then begin animation sequence.
   - If an asset fails, still render fallback but do not show grey blank tile; show a default gotchi silhouette card.

2) SCENE LAYOUT (FIX COMPOSITION)
   - Create a runway platform in the bottom third of the screen:
     - A rounded rectangle “floor” (cartoon) with soft glow outline.
     - Add subtle floor gradient and a center highlight stripe (like a catwalk lane).
   - Place BACKSTAGE centered above runway:
     - 2–3 rows or a shallow arc, centered horizontally.
     - Each backstage gotchi is small, opacity ~0.45, slight blur optional.
     - Add tiny idle float keyframe (very subtle).
   - ACTIVE gotchi is centered on runway:
     - scale ~1.8x of backstage.
     - align visually so it sits “on” the runway (use consistent baseline).
     - Add drop shadow under active gotchi (soft, blurred ellipse) that scales slightly during bounce.

3) FIX GOTCHI FRAMING (STOP LOOKING LIKE RANDOM TILES)
   Preferred: render SVG with transparent background (no white square).
   If transparency cannot be guaranteed:
   - Wrap gotchi in a consistent “stage card”:
     - rounded corners
     - subtle border in purple/teal
     - inner padding
     - soft shadow
   - Ensure ALL gotchis share the same frame style so it looks intentional.

4) MOTION QUALITY UPGRADE (KEEP SAME PHASES, IMPROVE FEEL)
   - All animations must use transform/opacity only.
   - Ensure transform-origin: center bottom for active gotchi.
   - Use non-linear easing: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) for entrances/exits.
   - Add bob loop during movement:
     - y: 0 → -4px → 0 (sync with travel)
   - Add arrival overshoot:
     - on reaching center: scale 1.0 → 1.04 → 1.0 over ~220ms
   - Pose timing:
     - pause at center: 200–300ms
     - then run the deterministic Move Pack (already implemented)
   - Keep spins tasteful (max 1 full spin).

5) UI TEXT / CHROME POLISH
   - Move “Backstage” label near the lineup (not bottom-left).
   - Keep CATWALK MODE badge top-left but reduce its visual weight slightly.
   - Add subtle vignette edges to focus attention on runway.

6) RESPONSIVE
   - Backstage layout adapts:
     - desktop: arc/rows centered
     - mobile: single row + horizontal scroll OR 2 rows but still centered
   - Active gotchi stays centered and never clips.

FILES
- Modify CatwalkModal + styles only.
- If needed add: src/components/catwalk/usePreloadAssets.ts (small hook).
- Do NOT touch Dress page logic besides opening modal + passing gotchis.

ACCEPTANCE
- No grey placeholder frames during show (preloaded).
- Backstage is centered behind runway and looks like a lineup.
- Runway looks like a cartoon stage (platform + glow).
- Active gotchi feels grounded (shadow + baseline).
- Motion feels smooth and intentional (ease + bob + overshoot).
