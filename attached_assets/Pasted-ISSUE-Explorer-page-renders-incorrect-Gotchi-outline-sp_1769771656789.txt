ISSUE: Explorer page renders incorrect Gotchi outline / spirit force colors (naked Gotchis do NOT match on-chain)

SUMMARY
The Explorer page is rendering naked Gotchis with the WRONG outline / spirit force colors. These colors do not match what is on-chain and do not match the Dress page rendering. This is incorrect and visually misleading.

Example:
- Gotchi: Lily
- Token ID: 1455
- Collateral: UNI
- Spirit Force / Outline Color: PINK (on-chain, correct on Dress page)
- Explorer page: outline color is incorrect

This is NOT a cosmetic issue. Spirit force color is a core Gotchi identity trait and must be consistent everywhere.

WHY THIS IS BAD (AND CONFUSING)
1) Spirit force color is deterministic and on-chain
- UNI gotchis ALWAYS have a pink outline when naked.
- This is not optional styling — it’s identity data.

2) Dress page proves the correct implementation already exists
- Dress page renders naked Gotchis with the correct outline color.
- Explorer page does NOT.
- This means Explorer is using a different (wrong) rendering path.

3) This breaks user trust
- Users will assume the Explorer is wrong or buggy (because it is).
- Visual inconsistency makes people doubt trait accuracy, rarity, and identity.

4) This causes visual chaos when browsing
- Two naked Gotchis with the same collateral appear different.
- Explorer grid looks inconsistent and unprofessional.

ROOT CAUSE (LIKELY)
The Explorer page is NOT using the same Gotchi SVG rendering logic as the Dress page.

Possible causes:
- Explorer uses a static image or cached SVG without spirit force applied
- Explorer omits collateral-based outline logic
- Explorer bypasses the canonical on-chain SVG generation path
- Explorer applies default / fallback colors instead of on-chain values

REQUIRED FIX (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The Explorer page MUST render naked Gotchis using the EXACT SAME logic as the Dress page.

Specifically:
- Use the SAME SVG generation function / helper used on the Dress page
- Use the SAME on-chain data inputs:
  - collateral type
  - haunt
  - base traits
- Do NOT reimplement or approximate spirit force coloring
- Do NOT hardcode colors
- Do NOT guess based on rarity or haunt

If the Dress page uses:
- a shared SVG helper
- a contract call
- a canonical subgraph field

THEN the Explorer MUST reuse that exact path.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1) Identify the canonical Gotchi SVG render function used on the Dress page
2) Extract or reuse it for Explorer rendering
3) Ensure naked Gotchi rendering:
   - applies spirit force outline color correctly
   - matches Dress page output pixel-for-pixel
4) Remove any Explorer-specific SVG shortcuts, fallbacks, or overrides

VERIFICATION STEPS (DO THESE)
- Load Gotchi #1455 (Lily) naked on:
  - Dress page
  - Explorer page
- Compare outline color
- They MUST match exactly
- Repeat with:
  - UNI collateral
  - AAVE collateral
  - other collateral types

SCOPE RULES
- This fix applies ONLY to Explorer Gotchi rendering.
- Do NOT change Dress page behavior.
- Do NOT change wearable rendering.
- Do NOT change trait logic.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Naked Gotchis render with correct on-chain spirit force colors in Explorer.
- Explorer and Dress page visuals are consistent.
- No collateral renders with an incorrect outline color.
- Example Gotchi #1455 (Lily) shows pink outline everywhere.

FINAL NOTE
This is not a “style tweak”.
This is a correctness bug.

Fix it by reusing the canonical Dress page rendering path — nothing else.
