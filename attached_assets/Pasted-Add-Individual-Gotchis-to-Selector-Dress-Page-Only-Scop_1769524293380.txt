Add Individual Gotchis to Selector (Dress Page Only)
Scope

This feature applies ONLY to the Dress page and its existing Gotchi Selector.
Do not add this to Home, Labs, or any other page.

Purpose

Allow users on the Dress page to manually search for and add individual Gotchis (by name or token ID) to the Gotchi Selector, in addition to loading Gotchis via wallet address.

Core Behavior (Dress Page)

Add a type-ahead search input inside the Dress page Gotchi Selector area.

The input must support searching by:

Gotchi name

Gotchi token ID

As the user types:

Display a live, type-ahead results panel

Results update in real time

Search Results UI

The search results panel:

Appears only while typing or when manually expanded

Shows matching Gotchis as selectable cards/rows

Each result must:

Use the same image size, layout, and styling as Gotchis in the Dress page Gotchi Selector

Render the Gotchi fully dressed

Display the same metadata/info shown for Gotchis already in the selector

This should reuse existing Dress page Gotchi rendering logic (do not create a new card style).

Selecting a Gotchi

Clicking a Gotchi in the search results:

Adds that Gotchi to the Dress page Gotchi Selector

Immediately collapses the search results panel

Triggers a re-sort of all Gotchis in the selector by rarity score (descending)

Selector Integration

Manually added Gotchis:

Behave exactly like wallet-loaded Gotchis

Participate in rarity sorting

Can be removed/deselected individually

Removal behavior should match the existing UX for removing manually added wallet addresses (but scoped to individual Gotchis).

Expand / Collapse Rules

Default state on the Dress page:

Only the type-ahead input is visible

While typing:

The search results section expands

After selecting a Gotchi:

The results section auto-collapses

Users may manually expand or collapse the results section at any time after initial use.

Constraints & Notes

This feature is Dress page only.

Do not introduce new global state outside the Dress page flow.

You may reference GotchiSlap for conceptual guidance only.

Do not replicate its UX, layout, or implementation.

Prioritize reuse of existing Dress page logic for:

Gotchi rendering

Metadata display

Sorting behavior
