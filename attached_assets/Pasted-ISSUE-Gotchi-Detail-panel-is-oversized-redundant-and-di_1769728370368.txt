ISSUE: Gotchi Detail panel is oversized, redundant, and disrupts Explorer flow — replace with hover / bottom-slider info reveal

PROBLEM SUMMARY
The current Gotchi Detail panel opens as a large side panel that:
- Repeats information already visible on the main Gotchi card
- Consumes excessive screen real estate
- Breaks browsing flow
- Feels heavy and unnecessary for Explorer use

For the Explorer page, this panel is overkill and should be removed.

Instead of a large detail panel, additional Gotchi info should be revealed **inline**, via:
- Hover (desktop)
- Bottom slide-up panel (mobile / optional desktop)

This keeps the Explorer fast, dense, and focused.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT
- Do NOT affect the existing hover behavior on the Gotchi IMAGE.
- Image hover is reserved exclusively for showing the Gotchi naked.
- This new behavior applies ONLY when hovering or interacting with the **info/details area of the card**, NOT the image.

REQUIRED CHANGE (HIGH PRIORITY)

REMOVE / DISABLE:
- The large Gotchi Detail side panel for Explorer usage.
- Clicking a card should NO LONGER open a full detail drawer.

REPLACE WITH:
- A compact “Additional Info” reveal that appears when:
  - Desktop: hovering over the card’s INFO section (name / traits / rarity area)
  - Mobile: tapping an info icon OR swiping up a bottom mini-panel

WHAT THIS NEW INFO REVEAL SHOULD SHOW

When triggered, display a compact overlay / slide panel containing:

SECTION 1: Wearables (with images)
- Show wearable icons/images (small but clear)
- Display wearable name on hover (desktop) or tap (mobile)
- Indicate total wearable count
- No long lists of text by default

SECTION 2: Supplemental Gotchi Info
Only info that is NOT already prominent on the main card:
- Collateral
- Owner (shortened + copy icon)
- Age (Ancient / days)
- Set name (if applicable)
- Optional: last interaction time

DO NOT repeat:
- Name
- Token ID
- Rarity score
- Traits
- Kinship
- Level
These already exist on the main card.

INTERACTION DETAILS

DESKTOP:
- Hovering over the info section triggers the overlay
- Moving cursor away closes it
- Overlay should not flicker or jump
- No click required

MOBILE:
- Add a small “info” icon OR caret in the card info area
- Tapping opens a bottom slide-up mini panel
- Swipe down or tap outside closes it

STYLE & BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
- Overlay / slide panel must be:
  - compact
  - fast
  - visually calm
- No full-screen takeovers
- No large side drawers
- Match GotchiCloset’s:
  - typography
  - colors
  - spacing
- Subtle shadow or elevation only if needed for separation

WEARABLE DISPLAY RULES
- Prefer icons/images over text
- Keep wearable images uniform in size
- No scrolling lists unless wearable count is large
- If scrolling is needed, limit height

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT interfere with Gotchi image hover (naked preview).
- Do NOT show duplicate info.
- Do NOT keep the large detail panel for Explorer.
- Do NOT add new navigation steps.
- This change applies ONLY to Explorer cards.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Explorer browsing feels faster and less cluttered.
- Users can see wearables and extra info without leaving context.
- Screen space is preserved.
- Mobile interaction feels intentional, not hacked.
- The detail experience feels “just enough,” not heavy.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Treat this as a replacement, not an addition.
- Remove dead code related to Explorer detail panel if no longer used.
- Keep Dress page detail behavior unchanged.
