TASK: Add “Trait Frequency Rarity” (1/N like 1/1, 1/20) to every Gotchi card in the Explorer grid, and show the breakdown (Eye Shape 1/N, Eye Color 1/N, Eye Combo 1/N) in the card (and tooltip / tap detail). This was missing and is now REQUIRED.

CONTEXT
- App: GotchiCloset
- New page: /explorer (Gotchi Explorer)
- Gotchi cards are dense and must show tons of info while still fitting many per page.
- We already have Eye Shape + Eye Color traits available on the gotchi (EYS, EYC or equivalent).
- This must work for: Mine / All / Baazaar / Auction modes.
- Mobile-friendly is mandatory: no hover-only UX.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
1) Do NOT touch Dress page/editor logic/calcs.
2) Trait Frequency Rarity must appear on the Gotchi card itself (not only in the drawer).
3) Default population scope: SAME HAUNT (do not mix haunts by default).
4) Compute counts efficiently (no per-card subgraph calls).
5) Must be deterministic + cached.
6) Works on mobile: show as badge + tap/long-press reveals more detail.

WHAT “1/N” MEANS (LOCKED)
- Trait Frequency Rarity:
  - For a given trait value (or combo), N = count of gotchis in the population sharing it.
  - Display as “1 / N”.
- Implement for:
  A) Eye Shape rarity: count by eyeShape value/bucket
  B) Eye Color rarity: count by eyeColor value/bucket
  C) Eye Combo rarity: count by (eyeShape + eyeColor) exact pair
- If N === 1, show “1 / 1” (optionally also label “Unique” in tooltip).

UI REQUIREMENTS (GOTCHI CARD)
- Add a compact badge overlay on the gotchi image area:
  - Label: “👁 1 / N” where N is Eye Combo rarity (primary, most valuable)
  - Keep it small, readable, and not ugly.
  - Tooltip (desktop) / tap info (mobile) must show:
    - Eye Combo: 1 / N
    - Eye Shape: 1 / N
    - Eye Color: 1 / N
    - Include a one-line explanation:
      “Trait Frequency Rarity: 1 of N Gotchis in this Haunt share this trait (or combo).”
- Do NOT require opening the detail drawer to see at least the Eye Combo rarity.

MOBILE UX
- Badge is always visible.
- On tap-and-hold (or a small “i” icon on card), open a tiny popover/bottom mini-sheet showing the breakdown:
  - Eye Combo 1/N
  - Eye Shape 1/N
  - Eye Color 1/N
  - Close on tap outside.

DATA / COMPUTATION (PERFORMANCE)
- Build a cached frequency map keyed by haunt:
  - eyeShapeCount[hauntId][eyeShapeKey] = count
  - eyeColorCount[hauntId][eyeColorKey] = count
  - eyeComboCount[hauntId][eyeShapeKey + "|" + eyeColorKey] = count
- IMPORTANT: do NOT compute by scanning only the currently loaded page; counts must reflect the population scope (same haunt), not just the page.
- Implementation options:
  Option 1 (preferred if feasible): one-time background fetch per haunt to build counts (chunked paging) and cache in memory (and optionally localStorage with versioning).
  Option 2: if subgraph supports aggregation/grouping, use that to fetch counts (best). If not, fall back to Option 1.
- Counts must be reused across modes (Mine/All/Baazaar/Auction) because the population is “same haunt”.
- Add safeguards:
  - While counts are building, show badge “👁 …” (loading) and fill in once ready.
  - Never block rendering of the grid while counts compute.

TRAIT KEYS / NORMALIZATION
- Use stable keys:
  - If you already map eye shape to named buckets (e.g., “Calm”, “Happy”), use that bucket key for counting.
  - If not, use the raw numeric trait value as key.
- Eye combo key = `${eyeShapeKey}|${eyeColorKey}`

FILES / ORGANIZATION
- Add module: src/lib/explorer/traitFrequency.ts
  - buildFrequencyMaps(gotchis: Gotchi[], scope: "haunt") => maps
  - getEyeShapeRarity(gotchi) => N
  - getEyeColorRarity(gotchi) => N
  - getEyeComboRarity(gotchi) => N
  - caching + memoization
- Add hook: src/hooks/useTraitFrequency.ts
  - ensures maps are available
  - exposes loading state + getters
- Update GotchiExplorerCard to render:
  - Eye Combo “1 / N” badge overlay
  - info popover content for breakdown
- Update GotchiDetailDrawer (optional) to reuse same data (do not duplicate logic).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Every gotchi card shows Eye Combo rarity as “1 / N”.
- Hover/tap reveals Eye Combo, Eye Shape, Eye Color rarities.
- Counts are for SAME HAUNT population, not just the loaded page.
- No per-card network calls.
- Mobile UX works (no hover dependency).
- Does not impact Dress page/editor.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement trait frequency rarity across the Explorer grid cards with caching and mobile-friendly breakdown UI.
