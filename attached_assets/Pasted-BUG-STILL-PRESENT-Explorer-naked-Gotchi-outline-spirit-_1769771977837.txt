BUG STILL PRESENT: Explorer naked Gotchi outline/spirit-force color still wrong (e.g., UNI Gotchi #1455 “Lily” not pink)

We already attempted “reuse Dress logic” and the output did not change. That means one of these is true:
1) Explorer is NOT actually using the Dress SVG path (still using a different renderer)
2) Explorer is using the same helper but with different inputs (collateral/haunt/traits missing or wrong)
3) Explorer is rendering an image that is not the on-chain SVG (sprite, cached PNG, precomputed svg, etc.)
4) CSS / filters / blending / backgrounds are altering colors after render
5) Caching is causing stale SVGs to persist (not invalidating when data changes)

YOUR JOB: Stop guessing. Prove which render path Explorer uses, diff it against Dress, then make Explorer match Dress pixel-for-pixel.

NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Explorer naked render MUST match Dress naked render for the same gotchiId.
- Fix must be deterministic and not rely on hardcoded color rules.
- Do NOT change Dress page.
- Do NOT change wearable logic.
- Fix Explorer rendering pipeline only.

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE ACTUAL RENDER PIPELINES (NO ASSUMPTIONS)
Find and list the exact code path for:
A) Dress page naked gotchi render (component + helper + data inputs)
B) Explorer page naked gotchi render (component + helper + data inputs)

For each, log/confirm:
- What function returns the SVG/string?
- Is it coming from:
  - on-chain SVG contract call?
  - subgraph svg field?
  - local generator?
  - cached asset?
  - sprite sheet / image URL?
- What inputs are provided?
  - gotchiId
  - collateral
  - hauntId
  - baseNumericTraits
  - modifiedNumericTraits
  - anything else

STEP 2 — ADD TEMP DEBUG DIAGNOSTICS (REMOVE AFTER FIX)
For gotchiId=1455 (Lily), in BOTH Dress and Explorer:
- Log a “render fingerprint” object to console:
  {
    source: "dress|explorer",
    gotchiId,
    hauntId,
    collateral,
    eyeShape,
    eyeColor,
    baseNumericTraits,
    hasSvgFromSubgraph: boolean,
    hasSvgFromContract: boolean,
    svgLength: number,
    svgHash: shortHash(svgString),
    svgContainsPink: boolean (string contains "#ff" patterns etc.),
  }

Also:
- Print out the first ~200 chars of the SVG string (enough to see style definitions) for both.
Goal: confirm whether the SVG strings are identical or not.

STEP 3 — DIFF THE SVG OUTPUTS
If svgHash differs between Dress and Explorer:
- You are not using the same SVG generator or you’re passing different inputs.
- Fix by making Explorer call the SAME function with SAME inputs.

If svgHash is the SAME but the visual differs:
- Something is altering visuals post-render (CSS, opacity, filters, background layers, image rendering).
- Investigate:
  - CSS filters on the svg container (filter, mix-blend-mode)
  - opacity overlays
  - background colors affecting perceived outline
  - any canvas draw step that changes colors

STEP 4 — ENSURE EXPLORER USES THE CANONICAL SVG SOURCE
Make Explorer use the EXACT same “naked svg” source as Dress.
Do NOT fallback silently.

Implement a single shared function (if not already shared):
- getNakedGotchiSvg(gotchi) -> svgString
and ensure BOTH pages call it (Dress already does — Explorer must too).

If Dress uses on-chain contract SVG:
- Explorer must call that same contract helper.
If Dress uses a subgraph svg field:
- Explorer must read that same field.

No half measures.

STEP 5 — FIX CACHING / STALE SVG
If Explorer caches SVG by gotchiId only:
- include collateral/haunt/version in the cache key
- ensure cache invalidates when switching from dressed to naked or when data updates

Also ensure that “naked preview” in Explorer is not accidentally reusing “dressed svg” cached entry.

STEP 6 — VERIFY WITH MULTIPLE COLLATERALS
After fix, verify naked outline/spirit-force color matches Dress for:
- UNI gotchi (pink outline) — use #1455 Lily
- at least one AAVE gotchi
- at least one other collateral
Take screenshots or log svgHash matching for each.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- For gotchiId 1455, Explorer svgHash matches Dress svgHash for naked render.
- The on-screen outline color matches on both pages.
- No CSS/filter differences remain between pages.

DELIVERABLE
- A concrete fix that makes Explorer naked rendering identical to Dress.
- Remove debug logs after confirming.
