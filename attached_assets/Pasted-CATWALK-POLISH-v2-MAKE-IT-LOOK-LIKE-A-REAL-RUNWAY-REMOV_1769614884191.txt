CATWALK POLISH v2 (MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A REAL RUNWAY, REMOVE FLASH, REMOVE CARD BORDERS)

Context: Catwalk modal works but looks like crap.
Problems to fix:
1) Gotchis “flash” (looks like a bug / opacity flicker). Remove all flash/camera effects on the active gotchi and any full-screen flashing overlays.
2) Background does not read as a runway/fashion show. Need a runway with forced perspective, crowd, and photographers vibe.
3) Gotchi rendering looks like square cards/tiles with borders. We want the gotchi itself, not a card UI.
4) “Walking” should look like moving from far-away to close-up (small → big), not sliding in 2D.

Hard guardrails:
- Do NOT change any dress/editor logic, selection, traits, BRS, respec, respect, or data.
- Catwalk remains a modal overlay only.
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- Must support prefers-reduced-motion (static view).

GOAL VISUAL:
- Aavegotchi-cartoon vibe.
- A real runway scene:
  - a 3D-ish runway plane (perspective)
  - crowds of gotchis on left/right edges (they ARE the crowd)
  - optional static “photographer” silhouettes near the front corners (no flashing)
- Active gotchi “walks” down runway: starts tiny at top center (far end), grows as it approaches, then does pose/move near front, then exits off to side.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

A) REMOVE FLASH / FLICKER BUG
- Search CatwalkModal styles/animations for any:
  - opacity keyframes
  - brightness/contrast filter pulses
  - full-screen overlay flashes
  - rapid box-shadow pulses
- Remove them completely.
- Ensure the active gotchi container never toggles display/visibility mid-animation.
- Ensure transforms are stable:
  - set transform-origin consistently (center bottom)
  - avoid re-mounting the active node between phases (keep one DOM node, change class/phase).

B) BUILD A REAL RUNWAY (CSS-ONLY, NO EXTERNAL IMAGES)
Inside the modal, create a “stage” scene:

Structure:
- <div class="catwalkStage">
    <div class="catwalkBackdrop" />
    <div class="catwalkCrowd catwalkCrowdLeft"> ...small gotchis... </div>
    <div class="catwalkCrowd catwalkCrowdRight"> ...small gotchis... </div>
    <div class="catwalkRunwayPerspective">
        <div class="catwalkRunwayPlane" />
        <div class="catwalkRunwayLane" />
    </div>
    <div class="catwalkActive">...active gotchi...</div>
  </div>

Key styling requirements:
- catwalkStage: position: relative; inset:0; overflow:hidden;
- Apply perspective on a parent:
  - .catwalkStage { perspective: 900px; }
- Runway plane:
  - .catwalkRunwayPlane should look like a long runway receding into the distance:
    - position absolute
    - width ~ 60vw
    - height ~ 90vh (tall)
    - centered horizontally
    - transform: translateX(-50%) rotateX(70deg) translateY(25vh);
    - background: subtle dark purple with a cartoon glow edge
- Runway lane marking:
  - Use repeating-linear-gradient to create center stripes that also recede with perspective.
- Add soft vignette and overhead haze so edges fade nicely.

C) CROWD = GOTCHIS (LEFT/RIGHT)
Replace “backstage cards” concept with a crowd:
- Use the same gotchi list to render crowd members (or subset if performance).
- Crowd placement:
  - left and right side of runway, arranged in 2–4 rows.
  - Each crowd gotchi is small, slightly rotated toward runway (left crowd rotateY(12deg), right rotateY(-12deg)).
  - Opacity ~0.6 but with some variation (seeded).
  - Add tiny idle float (slow, subtle) but NO flashing.
- IMPORTANT: crowd should frame the runway so you instantly read “fashion show”.

D) ACTIVE GOTCHI “WALK DOWN THE RUNWAY” (FORCED PERSPECTIVE)
Change the active movement path:
- Instead of moving left->right across screen, the gotchi moves from far end to near end.
- Start position (far):
  - top-center of runway
  - scale ~0.30–0.40
  - y near top (e.g. 10–15% from top)
- End position (near):
  - near bottom-center (e.g. 60–70% from top)
  - scale ~1.0–1.1
- Use a single keyframe for approach:
  - transform: translate(-50%, <farY>) scale(0.35) -> translate(-50%, <nearY>) scale(1.05)
  - include slight bob (2–4px) in the keyframe (cartoon walk).
- After reaching near end:
  - pause 200–300ms
  - perform the existing Move Pack (CLASSIC_TWIRL, PIVOT_POSE, etc.) but adapted to happen “in place” near the front.
- Exit:
  - step off to the side (translateX) while slightly scaling down (like leaving the runway), then fade out gently.
  - Do NOT flash.

E) REMOVE CARD BORDERS / SQUARE TILES (IMPORTANT)
Right now gotchis look like cards/tiles. Fix rendering:
Preferred approach:
- Render gotchis as inline SVG with transparent background.
- If you already have the gotchi SVG string (common in Aavegotchi tooling), inject it with dangerouslySetInnerHTML in a wrapper and style it.

If the SVG includes a background rect:
- Create a small helper that sanitizes the SVG string before render:
  - remove the first <rect> that fills the full canvas (common background)
  - remove elements with id/class containing: "bg", "background"
  - ensure svg root has style="background: transparent;"
Implementation notes:
- Do this only for Catwalk (do not affect editor rendering elsewhere).
- If current Catwalk uses an <img> with a baked background, replace it with SVG rendering used elsewhere in app (the same helper used to render gotchis on Dress page if available).

F) KEEP THE MODEL MOVE PACK (BUT NO EXTRA EFFECTS)
Keep the existing deterministic Move Pack:
- CLASSIC_TWIRL
- HALF_TURN_ILLUSION (cap rotateY <= 60deg)
- PIVOT_POSE
- SQUASH_STRETCH_POSE
- FLOAT_STRUT
- SPOTLIGHT_POP (but DO NOT flash the whole screen; only a subtle spotlight brightness, max 10%)
- MOONWALK_EXIT (<=10%)

But ensure moves are applied AFTER approach completes, near the front.

G) PREFERS REDUCED MOTION
If prefers-reduced-motion:
- show the runway scene static
- show crowd
- show the “top rarity gotchi” parked near the front
- show note: “Reduced motion enabled. Animations disabled.”

PERFORMANCE
- If selector has many gotchis, cap crowd to e.g. 30–50 gotchis (highest rarity first) and keep the rest unrendered in crowd.
- Use transforms only; avoid rerender loops during animation.
- Preload assets before starting animation sequence (no grey placeholders).

DELIVERABLES
- Update CatwalkModal + catwalk styles only.
- No changes to Dress page logic besides opening modal + passing list.
- The scene must clearly read as: RUNWAY + CROWD + ACTIVE GOTCHI WALKING TOWARD CAMERA.
